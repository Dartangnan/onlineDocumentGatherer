In this project, I developed a tool for accountants in Brazil to automatically fetch certificates from the Brazilian Ministry of Finance and make them available for download. In a conversation with a friend who owns an accounting company, I realized that it takes a lot of time for accountants to retrieve all debt certificates for their clients. 
<br/>
Hence, I started to develop a tool that retrieves the certificates once the company’s Federal Tax Identification Number is entered. Since the tool only retrieves certificates from the Ministry of Finance, and accountants also need certificates from other ministries, the user can register their name and email in this tool’s database so they can receive future information once the tool is completely developed.
